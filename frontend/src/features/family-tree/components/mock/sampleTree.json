    "bio": "Bob Marley, born Robert Nesta Marley on February 6, 1945, in Nine Mile, Jamaica, became a global icon of reggae music. His musical journey began in the early 1960s, forming the group The Wailers with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer. Their music, a fusion of reggae, ska, and rocksteady, resonated deeply with audiences worldwide. Marley's music was more than just entertainment; it was a powerful expression of his Rastafarian faith and a voice for social and political change. His lyrics addressed themes of freedom, justice, and unity, making him a symbol of hope and resistance. With albums like Catch a Fire, Burnin, and Exodus, he brought Jamaican music and culture to an international stage. Despite his untimely death from cancer in 1981 at the age of 36, Bob Marley's legacy endures. His music continues to inspire generations, and he remains a cultural figure recognized for his profound impact on music and his advocacy for peace and equality.",

Norval and Cedella married in 1945 but Captain Marley’s family strongly disapproved of their union; although the elder Marley provided financial support, the last time Bob Marley saw his father was when he was five years old; at that time, Norval took his son to Kingston to live with his nephew, a businessman, and to attend school. Eighteen months later Cedella learned that Bob wasn’t going to school and was living with an elderly couple. Alarmed, she went to Kingston, found Bob and brought him home to Nine Miles.",
